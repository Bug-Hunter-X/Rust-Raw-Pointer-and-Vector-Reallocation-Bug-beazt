This repository demonstrates a common bug in Rust related to using raw pointers with vectors.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that exhibits undefined behavior when modifying a vector through a raw pointer after the vector has been reallocated. The solution is presented in `bugSolution.rs`. This example highlights the importance of careful memory management in Rust, and the need to avoid using raw pointers when possible.  Using safe abstractions like iterators is generally recommended.
